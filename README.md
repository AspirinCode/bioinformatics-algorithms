These files comprise some of the bioinformatics algorithms work I have done. Below is a breif summary of what is within each file and each file contains a more detailed description in their respective READMEs.

<b>find_the_longest_path</b>
* Assembling a sequence from a directed graph

<b>identify_the_promoter_motif</b>
* Identifies a promoter motif based on statistical analysis of promoter sequences

<b>machine_learning</b>
* Implements a hidden Markov model to find the hidden path of a sequencing and its probability of occuring
* Employs Viterbi and Baum-Welch learning to find the emission and transition probabilities of a hidden Markov model

<b>mass_spec_cyclospectrum</b>
* Determines the cyclospectrum of a peptide
* Identifies all potential peptides from a spectrum

<b>sequence_constructed_from_kmers</b>
* Assembles kmers into a sequence by finding the Eularian path through a De Bruijn graph

<b>statistical_representation_of_motifs</b>
* Calculates the statistical significance of all motifs in a sequence
